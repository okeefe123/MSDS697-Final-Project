## Question: 

How successful has the implementation of Common Core been in terms of student achievement, growth, and motivation?


## Conclusions: 
- Only students who begin with this curriculum in early childhood have shown competency in SBAC assessments.
- Students in the eleventh grade on average performed worst out of all groups
- Fifth graders consistently increased in percentage meeting or exceeding standards per school
- The variance decreased and tends to skew towards the low end as grade level increased
- The average percentage of students who nearly met standards consistently decreased for all 3 focus grades.
